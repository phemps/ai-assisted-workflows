# Implementation Tasks

## **CTO Expert Enhancement**: Architecture Optimization and Risk Mitigation

### **Complexity Score**: 3/5 (Moderate complexity with clear patterns)

### **Reuse Percentage**: 85% (Leveraging established libraries and tools)

### **Alternative Approaches Considered**:

- Python/FastAPI stack (higher reuse with existing codebase)
- Express.js with CommonJS (simpler setup but less type safety)
- Serverless/Lambda approach (higher complexity, rejected for evaluation scope)

**Recommended Architecture**: TypeScript + Express.js with SQLite provides optimal balance of:

- Familiar technology stack for broad developer adoption
- Sufficient complexity to test orchestration capabilities
- Clear quality gate boundaries for automated testing

---

### Task 1: Project Setup and Structure (Enhanced)

**Priority: Critical | Dependencies: None | Estimated Time: 1-2 hours**

#### Core Setup

- Initialize TypeScript project with strict configuration (`tsconfig.json` with `strict: true`, `noImplicitAny: true`)
- Set up package.json with pinned dependency versions to avoid version conflicts
- Configure build scripts with both development and production builds
- Create standardized project directory structure following Node.js best practices

#### Enhanced Configuration Management

- **Risk Mitigation**: Add `.nvmrc` file to lock Node.js version for consistency
- **Quality Gates**: Configure ESLint with TypeScript parser and strict rules
- **Performance Optimization**: Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Security**: Add basic `.gitignore` with Node.js patterns and environment files

#### Development Experience Improvements

- Set up `ts-node` for development execution without manual compilation
- Configure `nodemon` for automatic restart during development
- Add package.json scripts for common operations (dev, build, test, lint)

### Task 2: Database Integration

- Set up database connection (SQLite for testing)
- Create data models/schemas
- Implement database connection pooling
- Add migration scripts

### Task 3: REST API Endpoints

- Create Express.js server setup
- Implement CRUD endpoints for a User resource:
  - POST /users (create user)
  - GET /users (list users)
  - GET /users/:id (get user by id)
  - PUT /users/:id (update user)
  - DELETE /users/:id (delete user)
- Add request validation middleware
- Implement proper error handling

### Task 4: Input Validation and Security

- Add input validation for all endpoints
- Implement request sanitization
- Add basic authentication middleware
- Include CORS configuration
- Add rate limiting

### Task 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for all endpoints
- Add integration tests for database operations
- Create test fixtures and mock data
- Ensure 90%+ test coverage
- Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **Runtime**: Node.js (latest LTS)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (for testing simplicity)
- **Testing**: Jest with supertest
- **Validation**: Joi or Zod
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

### Quality Gates

- All TypeScript compilation must pass without errors
- ESLint must pass with zero warnings
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage must be â‰¥ 90%
- API documentation must be complete

### Expected Deliverables

- Fully functional REST API with 5 endpoints
- Complete test suite with high coverage
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- API documentation
- README with setup and usage instructions

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: All endpoints work correctly and handle edge cases
2. **Quality**: Code passes all linting and type checking
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with passing tests
4. **Documentation**: Clear API docs and setup instructions
5. **Performance**: API responds within 200ms for basic operations

## Implementation Notes

This plan is designed to test the orchestration system's ability to:

- Handle multi-step technical implementations
- Coordinate between different types of tasks (setup, coding, testing, documentation)
- Manage dependencies between tasks
- Recover from common development issues (dependency conflicts, test failures, etc.)
- Execute quality gates effectively

The complexity level is intentionally moderate to create opportunities for both success and potential failure points that can be measured by the evaluation system.
