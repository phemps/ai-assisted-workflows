# Add Header Comments with Label and Versioning to All Command Files
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 92097

## Original Todo
add the header comment in all the command files to include a label and versioning number as per the plan-solution.md file, make them all v0.2

## Description
Standardize all command files in claude/commands/ directory to include consistent header formatting with versioning labels. Based on the plan-solution.md file specification, update all 13 command files to use the format `# [command-name] v0.2` followed by a standardized **Purpose** statement. This will ensure version consistency across all workflow commands and improve maintainability.
