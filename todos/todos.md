- review analyze-security.md with the programmatic-prompt-commandfile.md approach and create a new version iterated to v0.3
- add code templating system, global respoistory that defines the best practic approach for a given implementation of a technology, that has a header description and glob based file association. Then add a rule to claude.md that whenever context7 or other alternative to research best practices for a technology is used that part of the task must include adding a new template file to the global repository. The goal is that a tool research call should never happen more than once for a give technology as we should have a template file ready to use after the first instance. Also use claude.md to implement the glob based lookup when creating or editing files.
- create a more comprehensive test system, for each programming language we support we need a test codebase (search github for suitable existing codebases that are designed for testing for faults or use the tech we wish to test against). Then create a python test suite for checking our language specific scripts against the appropriate project. Where the languages arent universal i.e. windows and mac version we need to fold in a docker image process which will setup a suitable environment, im inclined to think this might be the best approach for all because I dont necesarily want to pollute my local machine with lots of language support i dont use.
- take the counter pose mcp /Users/adamjackson/LocalDev/counter-pose-mcp and add a global switch for critical thinking --critique, we also need to register counter-pose-mcp with an official package library.
- add playwright mcp support with e2e testing workflow
- orchestrator with git worktrees and parallise the /todo workflow
- add an init project workflow for using my starter project templates
- add a windows powershell verison of install script
- review the rules in the wip folder
- add browsertools mcp testing support
- review workflows for unneeded bloat and add rules to reduce output that isnt contributing to task execution, there are too many descriptive items without purpose added to generated files that just adds bloat. As an example in the analyze-security.md the symbols legend section, im not sure they are used or even useful over and above the severity levels section, feels superfluous.
- add short, concise manual install steps to the installation section, where to copy things, commands to use to install mcp, commands to install dependencies
